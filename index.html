      <h1>Ease Yourself Back into Cooking</h1>

    <div class="blog-intro">
      <p>There are plenty of reasons why “cook more” makes it onto so many New Year’s resolution lists. Cooking at home
        can save
        you money and help you to eat more healthfully, of course. And cooking can also be a real pleasure — one that
        can get
        you socializing with friends and family and can help you learn about history and cultures through different
        cuisines.
        When you cook at home, you can satisfy whatever craving you might have and dial in the flavors exactly how you
        like
        them.

        That said, even those of us who work with food for a living can fall into a cooking rut. So, to help, I’ve put
        together
        this list of 22 ways to ease yourself back into cooking this year. The key word here is ease — and some of the
        tips
        don’t involve cooking at all!</p>

      <p class="blog-content">If just looking at a long ingredient list has you reaching for the takeout menus, dip your
        toe back into the
        idea of
        cooking with some three-ingredient dinners. You don’t even have to make them yet — just save some that look
        tasty in
        your Kitchn recipe box or however else you save recipes you want to try. (I often just throw links in a Google
        doc.)
